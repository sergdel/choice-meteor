        <b>Choice Homestay</b> is now placing adult guests with our Gold Coast homestay families. We view this as a
        lovely way
        to
        connect and share more perspective
        with todayâ€™s decision makers as well as the decision makers of tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will have adult guests visiting most days of the year, visiting for 2 nights each with these itinerary
        requirements:
