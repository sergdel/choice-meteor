                                        It’s always better to ask your guests what they can eat and what they won’t eat,

                                        so best to ask them.

                                        Guests are visiting to experience an Australian way of life, and will usually
                                        enjoy your usual food choices, however it is good to provide Asian guests with
                                        additional rice options and spicy sauces such as Kimchi which you can easily
                                        find at Asian grocery stores.
